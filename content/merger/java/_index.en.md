        ```java {style=abap}   
        // Load the source DOCX file
        Merger merger = new Merger("sample1.docx");
        // Add another DOCX file to combine
        merger.join("sample2.docx");
        // Merge DOCX files and save the output
        merger.save("merged.docx");

    - title: "Split a PDF document into multiple files"
      content: |
        Use the [Split Document](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/java/split-document/) feature to break a large PDF into smaller, more manageable files. This is useful for extracting specific sections or pages. You can split a document using various criteria, such as page range, specific start and end pages, or even odd/even page numbers.
        {{< landing/code title="Split a document into multiple one-page files">}}
        ```java {style=abap}   
        // Split a PDF file using GroupDocs.Merger for Java API
        String filePath = "input.pdf";
        String filePathOut = "output.pdf";

        // Initialize the SplitOptions class with the output file format
        SplitOptions splitOptions = new SplitOptions(filePathOut, new int[] { 3, 6, 8 });

        // Create a Merger instance with the input PDF document
        Merger merger = new Merger(filePath);

        // Call the split method with the SplitOptions object to generate separate files
        merger.split(splitOptions);
