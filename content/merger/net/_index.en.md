        The [Selective Page Merge](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/net/merge-pages-from-various-documents/) feature allows you to extract and merge only the required pages from multiple DOCX files. Here's how to perform selective page merging using C#:
        {{< landing/code title="How to merge DOCX files in C#">}}
        ```csharp {style=abap}   
        JoinOptions joinOptions = new JoinOptions(1, 4, RangeMode.OddPages);
        
        // Load the source DOCX file
        using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample.docx", loadOptions))
        {
          // Add another DOCX file to include specific pages
          merger.Join(@"c:\sample2.docx", joinOptions);
          
          // Merge selected pages and save the output
          merger.Save(@"c:\result.docx");

      content: |
        Easily break a large PDF into multiple smaller files using the [Split Document](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/net/split-document/) feature. This helps with extracting specific sections or organizing content more efficiently. You can split documents based on various criteria, such as page range, specific start and end pages, or odd/even page numbers.
        {{< landing/code title="How to split a document into multiple multi-page files">}}
        ```csharp {style=abap}   
        // Use GroupDocs.Merger API to split a PDF file
        int[] splitPages = new int[] { 3, 6, 8 };
        
        // Set up SplitOptions with the output file format
        SplitOptions splitOptions = new SplitOptions(@"c:\result_{0}.{1}", splitPages, SplitMode.Interval);
        
        // Create a Merger instance and load the PDF document
        using (Merger merger = new Merger(@"c:\sample.pdf"))
        {
          // Call the split method with SplitOptions to generate separate files
          merger.Split(splitOptions);
