            TeX is a language that comprises of programming as well as mark-up features, used to typeset documents. Donald Knuth from Stanford University, is the creator of this resourceful typesetting system. Across the world, TeX is the ultimate choice of authors and publishers to produce high quality technical documents. TeX performs an outstanding job of formatting complex mathematical expressions. In conjunction with a high-quality phototypesetter, TeX competes the results generated by the best traditional typesetting systems. Therefore regarded as the classiest digital typographical systems. TeX input files are based on ASCII-code, thereby allowing manuscript sharing among writers, publishing managers and critics. A wide variety of computing environments, almost every modern platform and lot of older platforms support TeX. Moreover, TeX is a free software, available to a wide range of consumers. Many UNIX installations use both UNIX troff and TeX as their formatting system for different purposes. Other typesetting tasks are performed tremendously in the form of LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.
