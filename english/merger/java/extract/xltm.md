    title: "About GroupDocs.Merger for Java API"
    content: |
        GroupDocs.Merger for Java library offers a simple solution to safely merge & split between a wide range of document formats including PDF, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote), OpenDocument, HTML, images and many others within .NET applications. By adding just a few lines of the code, perform several document operations such as move, remove, rotate, swap, extract or change the orientation of pages within the documents. The documents merging API also supports previewing document pages as an image to analyse the document structure, formatting and content on the page.
        
        GroupDocs.Merger APIs are well supported on all major operating systems and Java versions including J2SE 7.0 (1.7), J2SE 8.0 (1.8) and Java 10.

          content: |
            The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later doesnâ€™t support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.
